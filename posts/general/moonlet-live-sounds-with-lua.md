##About Moonlet
[Moonlet](https://github.com/elihugarret/moonlet) is very small project/experiment that explores the intersection between sound (probably music) and live programming.
In other words it is just audio livecoding using the pretty little programming language: Lua. This project started at the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional in the faculty of Physics and Mathematics in Mexico City where I teach creative programming (yes! with Lua).

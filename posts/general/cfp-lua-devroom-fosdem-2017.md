In 2015 we had a Birds of a Feather meeting and in 2016 we had a real developer room for half a day. Both meetings were a big success and next year we will have half a day of a developer room again. 

We are now accepting submissions of talk proposals. The format will be 30 minutes talks, including questions (so roughly 20-25 minute talks, 5-10 minutes for Q&A). The talks will be filmed, possibly streamed live, and the videos will be made available publicly under a CC-BY license. Submitting a talk for the devroom implies that you agree to be filmed under such terms. 

All topics related to Lua are accepted. The deadline for submission is Thursday, 1st of December 2016.

All submission should be made using the FOSDEM even planning tool [Pentabarf](https://fosdem.org/submit). When you create your event, make sure to select "Lua devroom" under "Track". If you already have a Pentabarf account from a previous year, please reuse it instead of creating a new one. 

There is a [mailing-list](https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/lua-devroom) for the devroom, feel free to join and discuss talk ideas, recommend speakers, ask if anyone wants to talk about a topic you would like to know more about or discuss any other Lua devroom related topic.

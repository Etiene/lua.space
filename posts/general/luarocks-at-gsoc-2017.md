LuaRocks was selected by Google to be one of the participating organizations
in [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!

[Google Summer of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code)
is an international annual program, in which Google awards
[stipends](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends)
to students who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding
project during the summer. The program is open to university students aged 18
or over. The coding period goes from May 30 to August 29 (that is, the summer
break in the Northern Hemisphere). 

LuaRocks, the package manager for Lua, has been part of GSoC in the past as part of
the [LabLua](http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br) organization (a research lab at
PUC-Rio, the home of Lua). But this was the first time we applied as an 
independent organization, and we are very happy and thankful to be accepted.

Our global team of mentors (with people hailing from four continents!)
has produced a nice list of [project ideas](http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/gsoc/ideas2017.html),
but students are free and encouraged to contact us with ideas of their own as well!

## Applying to the program

If you are an eligible student and wish to apply, you should join the
[luarocks-developers mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/luarocks-developers) and
say hi at our [Gitter group](http://gitter.im/luarocks/luarocks).

Once you [find a project](http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/gsoc/ideas2017.html)
you are interested in, you should contact the mentor for that project by
email, and this [questionnaire](http://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/gsoc/apply2017.html).
If your application looks appropriate, the mentor may ask you to perform some
small task related to the project to assess your abilities, and discuss with
you how to best present your proposal. [Proposals accepted from March 20 to
April 3, 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5122941307060224/)!

Join us and come hack LuaRocks this next summer! (...or winter if you're in the
Southern Hemisphere! :) )
